### Project Overview

 You are given references to news pages collected from an web aggregator in the period from 10-March-2014 to 10-August-2014. The resources are grouped into categories that represent pages discussing the same story. News categories included in this dataset include business(b); science and technology(t); entertainment(e); and health(h).

The goal is to predict which class a particular resource belongs to given the title of the resource.


### Learnings from the project

 Solving it will reinforce the following concepts of text analytics:

Preprocess text data with tokenization, stopword removal etc
Vectorize data using Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches
Apply classifiers (Logistic and Multinomial Naive Bayes) to perform multi-class classification


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1.Load data and observe class distributions
2.Preprocess data and split into training and test sets
3.Vectorize with Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approach
4.Predicting with Multinomial Naive Bayes
5.Predicting with Logistic Regression
